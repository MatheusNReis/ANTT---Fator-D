The 'Fator D - Resumo Segmentos.bas' file may be used either for vertical or horizontal signage analysis, including both analysis at the same time. It should be applied with the results found by the algorithms in Vertical and Horizontal Signage folders.

In the codes stored in the folders:
  - Having the same initial title and varying the Modules numbers, like Módulo1 and Módulo2, means the codes belongs to a same workbook;
  - v1 and v2, for example, means version 1 and version 2 respectively.
  - Alignment algorithms shoulde be applied before the other ones.
